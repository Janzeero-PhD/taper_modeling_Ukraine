*_taper.csv: Plot - sample plot code MD - sample tree code d - diameter at breast height (outside bark, cm) h - total tree height (m) hi - height from a ground level (m) dob, tau - diameter outside bark and bark thickness at hight of hi (cm) Vob - stem volume outside bark calculated using Newton's sectional formula (cub. m) fob - cylindrical form factor of tree stem q1, q2, q3 - form quotients calculated as the ratio of a diameters measured at 1/4h (q1), 1/2h (q2), and 2/3h (q3) to diameter at breast height (outside bark) Age - tree age (years)
